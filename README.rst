Esper
=====
**Esper is a lightweight Entity System for Python, with a focus on performance.**

Esper is an MIT licensed Entity System, also commonly called Entity Component Systems (ECS).
The design is based on the Entity System concepts described by Adam Martin in his blog at
T-Machines.org, and others. Efforts were made to keep it as lightweight and performant as possible.

There is a fairly accurate writeup of what Entity System are in this Wikipedia article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system

Inspired by Sean Fisk's **ecs** https://github.com/seanfisk/ecs,
and Marcus von Appen's **ebs** https://bitbucket.org/marcusva/python-utils.



What's New
----------

**0.9.3** - Small API change, and different exception handling.
            The *World.delete_component* method has been renamed to *World.remove_component*
            for consistency. The *World.delete_entity* and *World.remove_component* methods
            will now raise a KeyError if the entity/component does not exist. Previously
            they would pass silently.

**0.9.2** - Switched to a different database structure internally. (No API changes)
            There are now examples for pyglet, Pygame, and PySDL2.
            Thanks to Christopher Arndt, multiple component queries are faster.

**0.9.0** - Esper should now be fully usable for your game or program.
            Example code for Pygame and PySDL. Pyglet example coming soon!


1) Compatibility
----------------
Esper is developed for Python 3. It is also know to work on Pypy3. Being written in pure
Python, it should work on any compliant interpreter. Python 2 is not supported in the main
branch for now, but Christopher Arndt is currently maintaining a branch here:
https://github.com/SpotlightKid/esper/tree/python2

2) Installation
---------------
No installation is necessary. Esper is a tiny library with no dependencies. Simply copy
the *esper* directory into the top level of your project folder, and *import esper*.

If you prefer, Esper is also available on PyPI for easy installation via pip.


3) Structure Guidelines
-----------------------
* World

A World is the main point of interaction in Esper. After creating a World object, you will use
that object to create Entities and assigning Components to them. A World is also assigned all of
your Processor instances, and handles smoothly running everything with a single call per frame.
Of course, Entities, Components and Processors can be created and assigned, or deleted while
your application is running.


* Entities 

Entities are simple integer IDs (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.).
Entities are "created", but they are generally not used directly. Instead, they are
simply used as IDs in the internal Component database, to track collections of Components.
Creating an Entity is done with the World.create_entity() method.


* Components

Components are defined as simple Python classes. In keeping with a pure Entity System
design philosophy, they should not contain any logic. They might have initialization
code, but no processing logic whatsoever. A simple Component might look like::

    class Position:
        def __init__(self, x=0.0, y=0.0):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y


* Processors

Processors, also commonly known as "Systems", are where all processing logic is defined and executed.
All Processors must inherit from the *esper.Processor* class, and have a method called
*process*. Other than that, there are no restrictions. All Processors will have access
to the World instance, to allow easy querying of Components. A simple Processor might look like::

    class MovementProcessor(esper.Processor):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()

        def process(self):
            for ent, (vel, pos) in self.world.get_components(Velocity, Position):
                pos.x += vel.x
                pos.y += vel.y

In the above code, you can see the standard usage of the World.get_components() method. This method
allows efficient iteration over all Entities that contain the specified Component types. You also
get a reference to the Entity ID for the current pair of Velocity/Position Components, in case you
should need it. For example, you may have a Processor that will delete certain Entites. You could
add these Entity IDs to a list, and call the *self.world.delete_entity()* method on them after
you're done iterating over the Components.


4) Usage
--------
The first step after importing Esper is to create a World instance. You can have a single World
instance for your entire game, or you can have a separate instance for each of your game scenes.
Whatever makes sense for your design. Create a World instance like this::

    world = esper.World()


Create some Processor instances, and assign them to the World. You can specify an
optional processing priority (higher numbers are processed first). All Processors are
priority "0" by default::

    movement_processor = MovementProcessor()
    collision_processor = CollisionProcessor()
    rendering_processor = RenderingProcessor()
    world.add_processor(movement_processor, priority=2)
    world.add_processor(collision_processor, priority=3)
    world.add_processor(rendering_processor)


Create an Entity, and assign some Component instances to it::

    player = world.create_entity()
    world.add_component(player, Velocity(x=0.9, y=1.2))
    world.add_component(player, Position(x=5, y=5))


Running all Processors is done with a single call to world.process(). This will call the
process method on all assigned Processors, in order of their priority::

    world.process()


Note: You can pass any args you need to *world.process()*, but you must also make sure to recieve
them properly in the *process()* methods of your Processors. For example, if you pass a delta time
argument as *world.process(dt)*, your Processor's *process()* methods should all receive it as:
*process(self, dt)*
